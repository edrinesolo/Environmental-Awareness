			<h3>1. <strong>Fencing</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>In areas where livestock grazing in wetlands or excessive human use is degrading wetlands, fencing is one of the simplest ways to protect your wetland. </li>
			  <li>This is especially critical in wetlands along streams and lakes where the degradation is directly impacting water quality through erosion and sedimentation.</li>
			  <li>Even if you can't fence all of your wetland, you can often fence off overused places where extra protection is necessary.</li>

    </ul>
			<h3>2.<strong> Recreational Use</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, canoeing, and bird watching are compatible with wetland protection as long as wildlife and their habitat are not disturbed by overuse. </li>
			  <li>If you and your family and friends are the only individuals using the wetland, then recreation activities are not likely to be a problem.</li>
			  <li>However, if you have many other individuals using your land who may not be sensitive to the needs of wildlife, </li>
			  <li>then you may need to limit some uses during critical times such as breeding or nesting seasons.</li>
			  <li>Accomplishing this might be as simple as a sign at access points of something more complicated like installing a fence or constructing a boardwalk to manage where people go in the wetland.</li>

    </ul>
			<h3>3. <strong>Â controlling Erosion</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>In shoreline areas that are experiencing erosion, controlling erosion is very important. </li>
			  <li>The first step in controlling erosion is to evaluate the nature and extent of the problem and determine if the problem is serious enough to warrant corrective action. </li>
			  <li>There are two basic reasons for controlling erosion: to protect property and to protect the environment. </li>
			  <li>If the erosion is largely the result of natural processes that do not harm the environment and that do not threaten property, </li>
			  <li>then erosion control may not be necessary.</li>
			  <li>Assuming that you determine the nature and extent of the erosion warrant corrective measures, </li>
			  <li>the next step is to look at the alternative methods of control and select the one that is most appropriate. </li>

			  </ul>
			<h3>4. <strong>Fertilizers and Pesticides</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>There are many safe alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides around the home. </li>
			  <li>Organic pesticide formulations, use of other insects to fight pests, and composting kitchen and yard waste to enrich soil have all been successful in meeting the needs of homeowners</li>
			  <li>Many homeowners use fertilizers when they do not need to. Before you decide to use fertilizers, you should get your soil tested to see if it is even necessary. </li>
			  <li>If you do use fertilizers or pesticides, follow manufacturer's directions carefully. Never apply more than is recommended. </li>
			  <li>On the farm, use pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers only when needed and within product guidelines. </li>
			  <li>The establishment of a chemical - free greenbelt to buffer the wetland from upland use of fertilizers and pesticides is very important.</li></ul>

			<h3>5. <strong>protect wetlands from adjacent human activities</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Perhaps the most effective management practice to protect wetlands from adjacent human activities is to establish and maintain a vegetative buffer around the wetland.  </li>
			  <li>Activities such as crop farming, brick laying, papyrus cutting</li>
			  <li><img src="img/human.jpg"></li>
			  </ul>

			  <h3>6. <strong>Septic Systems</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Septic systems also are a source of pollutants to wetlands. Be sure your septic system is operating properly.  </li>
			  <li>If you notice the area over your drain field is wet or particularly green, or if you can smell sewage during rainy periods, then your system is not working properly. </li>
			  <li>Seepage from your system may be polluting nearby areas, including your wetland.  </li>
			  <li>To avoid this problem, have your septic system pumped and inspected every three to five years (or less, depending on the system) and commit to upgrading the system when necessary.  </li>
			  <li>In addition, water conservation practices such as installing low-flow toilets and shower heads can extend the life of a septic system </li>
