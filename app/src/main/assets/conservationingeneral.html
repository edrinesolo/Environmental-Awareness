	<h3>1. Recycling</h3>
	<ul type="disc">
	<li>Recycle everything you can and try to buy reusable and biodegradable products as much as possible.</li>
    <li> Whether it is glass or paper, plastic or metal, all these materials can be re-used.</li>
    <li>Empty jars, wine bottles, broken glasses and absolutely any other item made of glass which is no longer useful should be recycled. It takes a million years for glass to decompose</li>
	</ul>		
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Also, old newspapers, paper wraps, cardboard, sheets of paper you no longer need should all reach the paper container and be sent in order to be recycled. Millions of trees will thank you for that.</li>

      </ul>
			<h3>2. Reduce water consumption</h3>
	
			<ul type="disc">
			  
			  <li>Water is life. Clean, fresh water tends to become more and more precious as time goes by and, if we do nothing to save it, in the not so far future, water will be more precious than gold.</li>
			 <li>It is therefore crucial for us to do whatever they can in order to save it and to prevent water pollution. </li>
			 <li>It is not a difficult task, just turn the tap off while you brush, reduce the number of baths and take showers instead, use the washing machine only when you can actually fill it with clothes.</li>
			 <li>Used oil or paint should not be discarded into the drains as they will pollute the rivers and finally the seas.</li>
			 <li><img src="img/water.jpg" width="246" height="232"></li>
      </ul>
			
    </ul>
			<h3>3. Reduce the use of electricity</h3>

			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>You will save not only energy but also money from your electricity bill! Replace regular bulbs with energy saving light bulbs.</li>
	  </ul>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>If everyone did that, it would be like millions of cars would be removed from the road. Once you leave the office, physically turn off your computer and monitor. You will prolong their life and reduce electricity consumption in the process. Do that at home as well.</li>
	  </ul>
			<h3>4.Plant a tree</h3>
	<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Trees are our source of oxygen and we cut them down instead of planting them</li>
