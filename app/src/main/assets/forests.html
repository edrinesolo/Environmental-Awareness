  <h3>1.Afforestation</h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Afforestation is a proactive method used to improve forests.</li>
			  <li>Afforestation is the planting of trees for commercial purposes. Afforestation is a way to create a forest. </li>
			  <li>Afforestation occurs when the planting of trees is introduced to an area that previously had no trees. </li>
			  <li>This creates habitat for wildlife, recreational areas, and commercial use while not causing harm to natural forests.</li>

    </ul>
	<h3>2.<strong> </strong>Reforestation</h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Reforestation is another method to sustain forests by improving existing forested areas. </li>
			  <li>Reforestation is a method of planting trees in an existing forested area. </li>
			  <li>This method is used in reaction to deforestation.</li>
			  <li>When forests are removed without reestablishment they can be reforested by planting trees in the same area to rebuild the existing forest.</li>

    </ul>
	
			<h3>3. <strong>Â </strong>Selective logging</h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Selective logging is another method used to meet the needs of both the forests and humans seeking economical resources.</li>
			  <li>Selective logging is the removal of trees within a stand based on size limitations. </li>
			  <li>This technique allows for forest regeneration to occur between and after the selective harvest cycles.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>4. <strong>Controlled burn</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>Although it can be threatening if it is not controlled, fire is a successful way to conserve forest resources. Controlled burn is a technique that is used to manage forests.</li>
			  <li>Fire can benefit the ecosystem within a forest. Fire is natural and it is also a tool of foresters used to improve the forests.</li>
			  <li>It renews the forest undergrowth and also stimulates the germination of trees species.</li>
			  <li>In some species of trees such as the Sequoia, seedlings remain in dormancy until broken by fire. As a result, these species cannot reproduce without fire.</li>

			<h3>5. <strong>Reduce Bush burning</strong></h3>
			<ul type="disc">
			  <li>This has greatly led to deforestation with its related problems</li>
